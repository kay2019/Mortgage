# Mortgage Prepayment Modeling

For many financial institutes mortgages are considered important part of revenues. With any possible revenue comes its corresponding risk. Many research has already been done in this direction but the problem is complex as many different parameters can correlate with each other. One direct factor of measuring risk is this regard is called prepayment. That's when the borrower of the mortgage leaves the contract. Depending on the time of prepayment, a financial institute can profit or lose. We use the public data of Fannie Mae listed in the Federal Housing Finance Agency for our purpose. In the pair plots bellow, we show some of the parameters that have effect on the prepayment. We propose a deep learning method for the prediction of prepayment. Our goal is to determine the profile of the mortgage borrowers and classify them in a way that can result in the predictability of mortgage termination or refinance. This will help financial institutes to trade fixed-income products efficiently.
